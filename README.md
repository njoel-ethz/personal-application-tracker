# Personal Job Application Tracker
Help to manage and organize your job search effectively. Allow users to create, read, update and delete job applications entries. Features include setting their status, category, contact details and potential deadline reminders. The app should have an appealing color scheme (preferably from a personal reference image).

Future work could include searching specific entries given buzzwords or more involved progress tracking visualizations.
